This is my code. Isn't it nice? I hope it makes it to the server :)
My added stuff. More added stuff. Even more added stuff. Adding more to test stuff.
Now testing spaces in directory... Testing again...
Testing initial sync + change detection.
It worked! Now I'm happy :)
Removing progress statements.
Now adding a timestamp to each synchronization.
This is great.
